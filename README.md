# Winter 1993 Simulation

This repository implements the Winter 1993 model, an expansion of the evolutionary frameworks introduced in Nelson and Winter (1982) and refined in Winter (1983). The simulation explores the dynamic interplay between innovation, firm behavior, and institutional influences over time.

## Background
The Winter 1993 model builds upon the foundations of evolutionary economics, emphasizing routines, bounded rationality, and technological innovation. Winter (1983) extended these concepts by refining mechanisms of innovation and market structure. The 1993 model compared to 1982 introduces:

- Firm Entry and Exit Dynamics.
- Performance Metrics.
- Adaptive R&D Policies Based on Firm Performance
- Dual Innovation Regimes
- Patent Activity. (Just creation)


### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
